## Overview
Bragging time! This challenge was completed in less than 12 hours. Although I was doing other things in-between. I fully utilized reacts seperation of concerns nature to create truly modular components and files that do only one thing, this makes the application easily extendable and maintainable. There are no unused variables or console logs.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Make selections to create a coffee subscription and see an order summary modal of their choices

### Links

- Live Site URL: [netlify.app](https://unruffled-varahamihira-8badfa.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with
- TailwindCSS
- CSS custom properties (for universal attributes like brand color)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Deepened my knowledge of Tests and React context
I am proud of the application I built and the logic applied, it is non-trivial if I am honest.



### Continued development

Continuous development would be around building more reusable components, which I applied appropriately here. I want to be able to envision an app before I start building instead of crossing the bridge when I get there.

### Useful resources

- [academind](https://academind.com/tutorials/testing-react-apps/) - I used this to review more testing APIs that can be incorporated into my work.
- [creative-tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/documentation/react/modals/regular) - I used this to quickly bootstrap the modal for the final order.

## Acknowledgments

I enjoyed the process of building out this project, because a Figma file was provided. It answered all the questions I had about design and functionality. It also saved me the time that would have been spent second guessing my design, if I had to create one myself.
